#ResolveGitMergeConflict CAN USED or 
#ResolveGitMergeConflictUI is UI based to make the merging decision easier.

# The provided script is a custom merge conflict resolution tool built using the GitPython library and the Tkinter library for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows you to interactively resolve merge conflicts by providing options to keep changes from one side, keep changes from the other side, or manually merge the changes.

# On the other hand, the Git command-line tool already provides a built-in mechanism for merging branches and resolving conflicts. When you use the git merge command, Git automatically attempts to merge the changes from two branches and resolves conflicts to the best of its ability. It provides markers in the conflicted files that indicate the conflicting sections, and it's up to the user to manually edit the files to resolve the conflicts.

# The main difference is that the custom script with the GUI provides a more interactive and user-friendly approach to resolving merge conflicts. It presents a visual interface that displays the conflicted files and their content, and allows you to choose the resolution strategy for each conflict. This can be helpful for users who prefer a more guided and intuitive way of resolving conflicts, especially for those who may not be familiar with the intricacies of Git conflict resolution.

# Ultimately, whether to use the custom script or the built-in Git merge tool depends on personal preference and the specific needs of your workflow. The custom script can provide a more user-friendly experience, but it requires additional setup and may not cover all possible conflict resolution scenarios. The built-in Git merge tool is more versatile and can handle a wider range of scenarios, but it requires manual editing of the conflicted file
